DESCRIPTION:
The administration is extravascular with a first order absorption (rate constant ka).
The PK model has one compartment (volume V) and a linear elimination (clearance Cl).


[LONGITUDINAL]
input = {ka, V, Cl}

EQUATION:

; PK model definition
Cc = pkmodel(ka, V, Cl)

OUTPUT:
output = Cc
